Google Cloud is a provider of computing resources for deploying and operating applications on the web. Its specialty is providing a place for individuals and enterprises to build and run software, and it uses the web to connect to the users of that software. Inside Google Cloud Platform (GCP), we can run a website or an application or a service with Google keeps track of all of the resources the application or services uses, specifically how much processing power, data storage, database queries, and network connectivity it consumes. One of the advantages of using Google Cloud Platform is that rather than lease a server or a DNS address by the month, in GCP you just pay for each of these resources on a per-second basis (competitors charge per-minute), with discounts that apply when your services are used heavily by your customers on the web.

Google Cloud Platform is perceived to have certain competitive strengths like automating the deployment of modern applications (as an app is made of many moving parts, many developers prefer to build their apps in the cloud for debugging or as usually called "cloud-native"), creative cost control as Google's strategy with GCP is to enable cost competitiveness in certain "sweet spot" scenarios like a lifecycle manager for its object data storage, which enables the offloading or deletion of objects that haven't been used in 30 days or more, and friendlier hand-holding for first timers. GCP offers a step-by-step examples of doing many of the tasks that newcomers might find complicated.

One of the major services used in Google Cloud Platform is Google Compute Engine (GCE) that hosts virtual machines or VMs, servers that exists entirely as software. Other services like Google App Services (software development with tools and langauges such as Python, PHP, and even .NET languages), Google Cloud Storage, BigQuery (data warehousing system), and Cloud AutoML (enable applications to leverage machine learning) are also widely used.
